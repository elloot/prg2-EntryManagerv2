# Entry manager v2
This project is a reworked version of my previous Entry manager (a program that stores entries for different users, could be used as a type of logbook). In this version my goal was to refactor my previous code to make it easier to read and understand, as well as add some features that I thought were needed (ex. database integration).

The JavaDoc for this project can be found [here](https://elloot.github.io/prg2-EntryManagerv2/Controller.html). **Note**: I only had time to write documentation for the `Controller` class. This documentation only includes descriptions for a few methods as I had very limited time to write the documentation and the project has gotten quite large.

The Post Mortem for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/elloot/prg2-EntryManagerv2/tree/main/pm.md).
